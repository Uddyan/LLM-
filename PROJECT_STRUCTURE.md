## Overview

This platform provides Neighborly (world's largest home services franchisor with 19+ brands and 5,500+ franchises) with:

1. **Automated Training**: Self-improving LLM that learns from data lake without manual prompt engineering
2. **Intelligent Agents**: 6 specialized MCP server agents for different business functions
3. **Scalability**: Cloud-native architecture that grows with the business
4. **Cost-Effectiveness**: Balance between performance and cost
5. **Security**: Enterprise-grade security and compliance

## Key Features

- Automated data ingestion and preprocessing from multiple sources
- Self-training pipelines with continuous learning
- RAG for always-current information
- Agent orchestration for complex multi-step tasks
- Multi-brand franchise coordination
- 24/7 customer service automation

## Technology Stack

- **LLM**: Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Llama 3.1 70B/405B
- **Vector DB**: Pinecone, Weaviate, or Chroma
- **Data Pipeline**: Apache Kafka, Airflow, Spark
- **MCP Framework**: FastMCP, LangGraph
- **Cloud**: AWS or Azure
- **Orchestration**: Kubernetes

## Getting Started

Each directory contains its own README with specific instructions. Start by reviewing:

1. `/data-pipeline/README.md` - Data ingestion and processing
2. `/model/README.md` - Model training and fine-tuning
3. `/mcp-agents/README.md` - MCP server agents overview
4. `/docs/README.md` - Full documentation

## Implementation Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (Months 1-3)**: Foundation - Data infrastructure and preprocessing
- **Phase 2 (Months 4-6)**: Core agent development
- **Phase 3 (Months 7-9)**: Fine-tuning and optimization
- **Phase 4 (Months 10-12)**: Production deployment

## Documentation
